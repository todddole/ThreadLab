Note: Because the FY2010 DOD Appropriations Act was approved by both
chambers by exchanging different versions of H.R. 3326 , no
conference report was issued. Section 1014 of the final version,
however, provides that the explanatory statement inserted in the
Congressional Record on December 16, 2009, would be equivalent to a
conference report (i.e., "shall have the same effect with respect to
the allocation of funds and implementation of this Act as if it were a
joint explanatory statement of a committee of conference"). In January
2010, the House Appropriations Committee issued an unnumbered
committee print, with the Joint Explanatory Statement printed in
